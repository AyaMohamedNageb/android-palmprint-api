= Palm area labeling =

  The palm area labeling is based on the normal gray image segment. 
# compute the luma distribution of a rectangle area; 
# mark the whole area of same distribution with 5*sigma; 
# sharp the whole area with a fixed edge distance.

  The labeled palm area will be showed overlapped on raw images likes:
